DNA is the genetic material of all organisms on Earth. When DNA is transmitted from parents to children, it can determine some of the children's characteristics (such as their eye color or hair color). But how does the sequence of a DNA molecule actually affect a human or other organism's features? For example, how did the sequence of nucleotides (As, Ts, Cs, and Gs) in the DNA of Mendel's pea plants(Opens in a new window) determine the color of their flowers?

A DNA molecule isn't just a long, boring string of nucleotides. Instead, it's divided up into functional units called genes. Each gene provides instructions for a functional product, that is, a molecule needed to perform a job in the cell. In many cases, the functional product of a gene is a protein. For example, Mendel's flower color gene provides instructions for a protein that helps make colored molecules (pigments) in flower petals.

The functional products of most known genes are proteins, or, more accurately, polypeptides. Polypeptide is just another word for a chain of amino acids. Although many proteins consist of a single polypeptide, some are made up of multiple polypeptides. Genes that specify polypeptides are called protein-coding genes.

the proteins that are the functional products of genes are the molecules that actually perform most of the jobs in the cell. For example, proteins called enzymes catalyze all of the chemical reactions in the cell. Other proteins, such as hemoglobin, are used to build cellular structures or to transport molecules from one place to another. Still other proteins, such as antibodies, are used to defend the cell against foreign invaders.

That's DNA contains the instructions for making proteins, and that these instructions are copied onto RNA molecules, which are then translated into the amino acid sequences of proteins. This idea is sometimes called the central dogma of molecular biology.

Many genes provide instructions for building polypeptides. How, exactly, does DNA direct the construction of a polypeptide? This process involves two major steps: transcription and translation.

In transcription, the DNA sequence of a gene is copied to make an RNA molecule. This step is called transcription because it involves rewriting, or transcribing, the DNA sequence in a similar RNA "alphabet." In eukaryotes, the RNA molecule must undergo processing to become a mature messenger RNA (mRNA).

In translation, the sequence of the mRNA is decoded to specify the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. The name translation reflects that the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA sequence must be translated into the completely different "language" of amino acids.


## Transcription
Transcription is the first step in gene expression, in which information from a gene is used to construct a functional product such as a protein. The goal of transcription is to make a RNA copy of a gene's DNA sequence. For a protein-coding gene, the RNA copy, or transcript, carries the information needed to build a polypeptide (protein or protein subunit). Eukaryotic transcripts need to go through some processing steps before translation into proteins.

The main enzyme involved in transcription is RNA polymerase, which uses a single-stranded DNA template to synthesize a complementary strand of RNA. Specifically, RNA polymerase builds an RNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction, adding each new nucleotide to the 3' end of the strand. 

Transcription of a gene takes place in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Here, we will briefly see how these steps happen in bacteria. You can learn more about the details of each stage (and about how eukaryotic transcription is different) in the stages of transcription(Opens in a new window) article.

    - Initiation. RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called the promoter, found near the beginning of a gene. Each gene (or group of co-transcribed genes, in bacteria) has its own promoter. Once bound, RNA polymerase separates the DNA strands, providing the single-stranded template needed for transcription.
    - Elongation. One strand of DNA, the template strand, acts as a template for RNA polymerase. As it "reads" this template one base at a time, the polymerase builds an RNA molecule out of complementary nucleotides, making a chain that grows from 5' to 3'. The RNA transcript carries the same information as the non-template (coding) strand of DNA, but it contains the base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).
  - Termination. Sequences called terminators signal that the RNA transcript is complete. Once they are transcribed, they cause the transcript to be released from the RNA polymerase. An example of a termination mechanism involving formation of a hairpin in the RNA is shown below.

After termination, transcription is finished. An RNA transcript that is ready to be used in translation is called a messenger RNA (mRNA). In bacteria, RNA transcripts are ready to be translated right after transcription. In fact, they're actually ready a little sooner than that: translation may start while transcription is still going on!
In the diagram below, mRNAs are being transcribed from several different genes. Although transcription is still in progress, ribosomes have attached each mRNA and begun to translate it into protein. When an mRNA is being translated by multiple ribosomes, the mRNA and ribosomes together are said to form a polyribosome.


## Translation
During translation, a cell “reads” the information in a messenger RNA (mRNA) and uses it to build a protein. Actually, to be a little more techical, an mRNA doesn’t always encode—provide instructions for—a whole protein. Instead, what we can confidently say is that it always encodes a polypeptide, or chain of amino acids.

In an mRNA, the instructions for building a polypeptide are RNA nucleotides (As, Us, Cs, and Gs) read in groups of three. These groups of three are called codons.
There are 616161 codons for amino acids, and each of them is "read" to specify a certain amino acid out of the 202020 commonly found in proteins. One codon, AUG, specifies the amino acid methionine and also acts as a start codon to signal the start of protein construction.

There are three more codons that do not specify amino acids. These stop codons, UAA, UAG, and UGA, tell the cell when a polypeptide is complete. All together, this collection of codon-amino acid relationships is called the genetic code, because it lets cells “decode” an mRNA into a chain of amino acids.


Steps of translation
Your cells are making new proteins every second of the day. And each of those proteins must contain the right set of amino acids, linked together in just the right order. That may sound like a challenging task, but luckily, your cells (along with those of other animals, plants, and bacteria) are up to the job.
To see how cells make proteins, let's divide translation into three stages: initiation (starting off), elongation (adding on to the protein chain), and termination (finishing up).
Getting started: Initiation
In initiation, the ribosome assembles around the mRNA to be read and the first tRNA (carrying the amino acid methionine, which matches the start codon, AUG). This setup, called the initiation complex, is needed in order for translation to get started.
Extending the chain: Elongation
Elongation is the stage where the amino acid chain gets longer. In elongation, the mRNA is read one codon at a time, and the amino acid matching each codon is added to a growing protein chain.
Each time a new codon is exposed:

    A matching tRNA binds to the codon
    The existing amino acid chain (polypeptide) is linked onto the amino acid of the tRNA via a chemical reaction
    The mRNA is shifted one codon over in the ribosome, exposing a new codon for reading


During elongation, tRNAs move through the A, P, and E sites of the ribosome, as shown above. This process repeats many times as new codons are read and new amino acids are added to the chain.
For more details on the steps of elongation, see the stages of translation article.

Finishing up: Termination
Termination is the stage in which the finished polypeptide chain is released. It begins when a stop codon (UAG, UAA, or UGA) enters the ribosome, triggering a series of events that separate the chain from its tRNA and allow it to drift out of the ribosome.
After termination, the polypeptide may still need to fold into the right 3D shape, undergo processing (such as the removal of amino acids), get shipped to the right place in the cell, or combine with other polypeptides before it can do its job as a functional protein.



Elongation is the second stage of translation, where the polypeptide chain is extended by adding amino acids. During elongation, the ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading the codons and adding the corresponding amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain.

The first step of elongation is the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the ribosome. The aminoacyl-tRNA is a tRNA molecule that carries a specific amino acid, and its anticodon is complementary to the codon in the A site of the mRNA. The binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site is facilitated by elongation factors.

Once the aminoacyl-tRNA is bound to the A site, the ribosome catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acid carried by the aminoacyl-tRNA and the growing polypeptide chain. This reaction is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an enzyme that is part of the ribosome.

After the peptide bond is formed, the ribosome moves one codon along the mRNA, shifting the peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site. The A site is now empty and ready to receive the next aminoacyl-tRNA. The tRNA that was in the P site is now in the E site, and it is released from the ribosome.

The process of elongation continues until a stop codon is reached in the mRNA. At this point, the ribosome releases the polypeptide chain and dissociates from the mRNA.

In summary, elongation is the stage of translation where the polypeptide chain is extended by adding amino acids. The process involves the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the ribosome, the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acid and the growing polypeptide chain, and the movement of the ribosome along the mRNA. The process continues until a stop codon is reached in the mRNA.





The process of translation, which is responsible for the synthesis of polypeptides, is terminated through a series of events that occur when a stop codon in the mRNA (UAA, UAG, or UGA) enters the A site. This process is known as termination.

Stop codons are recognized by proteins called release factors, which fit neatly into the P site of the ribosome. Although they are not tRNAs, release factors are able to interact with the enzyme that normally forms peptide bonds. They cause the enzyme to add a water molecule to the last amino acid of the chain, which results in the separation of the chain from the tRNA. The newly synthesized protein is then released.

Following termination, the small and large ribosomal subunits separate from the mRNA and from each other. These elements are highly reusable and can quickly take part in another round of translation.
