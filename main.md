2.Content Guidelines:

    One of the grading criteria used for this are reflective questions on their experience during the course. Reflective questions used for reference are the 5R framework, which are reporting, responding, relating, reasoning & reconstructing.
    5R Framework breakdown:

    Reporting: Presenting the context or interpretation of the experience. Reporting includes brief descriptions of things that already happened in the past. Some key words that can be used as an indicator are: ‘I saw..’, ‘I noticed…’, etc.
    Responding: Reaction to the experience/situation. These could be thoughts, feeling or observations during the incident. Key words that can be used as an indicator are: ‘I felt..’, ‘I thought…’, ‘I believe…’..
    Relating: Relate the experience/situation using past context/knowledge outside the situation. This implies attendees have a deep understanding of the experience and are able to match those with similar situations that they had experience prior. Some keywords that indicate this are: ‘Previously..’, ‘Unlike…’, etc.
    Reasoning: Giving their current thoughts/opinion of the experience. This shows attendees understand significant factors of the situations/incidents and its importance. Keywords that often indicates this are: ‘I realize..’, ‘I understand that…’, etc.
    Reconstructing: Able to provide a conclusion & action plan based on their interpretation of the experience. Reconstructing are attendees current thoughts on their next action plan (something that they want to do in the future). This have similar keywords as reasoning, which are ‘I need to..’, ‘In the future….’, etc.

    Question Prompt for Reflective Question:

General question: 

“Can you describe one of the key learning points that you receive during the program?”

    Reporting: “What happened during the program?”
    Responding: “What did I think about that situation?”
    Relating: “Is there any similar situation that happened to me before?”
    Reasoning: “How does my perspective differ prior joining the program?”
    Reconstructing: “How would I do this differently in the future?”




1. I know generasi gigih from twitter, yes, i belive it was from kak Mikael Dewabrata.
2. why i want joining beacuse from the first year i want to learn about web dev (im a math major with a heart of Computer Science). But web dev definetely not only things that i want to learn. 
3. i try to self-study webdev before through any other sources, like fullstackopen, project odin. but as i have other things to do, i cant focus on it.
4. i see this as an opportunity to learn webdev, a summer (uni break) that i can use to learn webdev.
5. after do the administrations, there's a test to join this program. 
6. so i joining generasi gigih 3.0 program on my final year, and also during the summer. 
7. there's a warm welcome before a storm (when the program started) by all stakeholder, mentor and anyone that involved in this program.
8. my thought on this program is, this wont be as easy as bangkit that i joined before because it's my first time learning about web dev (even though i always want to learn webdev before, but lack of motivation and also i dont know where to start).
9. there's atmost 4 synchronus class each week (that hold for 6 weeks) 2.5 hours each. thanks to kak Krisna Firdaus, Zahrah Ayu Afifah Febriani, Ananda Affan Fattahila, Varianto Angga Prawira, Jessica Cecilia Budianto for a wonderful class.
10. also there's progate (an coding platform that u need to finished) that we can learn from (not a fan but it's a good additional)
11. it's my first time working on a web kinda technologies. it's definetely not a walk in the park. but each weeks i can see my progress.
12. unlike bangkit, i belive there's more asynchronous class on hardskill, which i particularly like.
13. lets talk about softskill class. our soft skill class is given by kak david paulus. one thing that i love from this class is, it's has less hour than bangkit softskill class. i dont think softskills class is a bad thing, but i think it's better to learn it theoritically too much since it will kill the sense of it.
14. also while i can see why kak david one of top talent in softskills thingy, but i still really sucks at it. i think most of this are common sense, so i rarely has an counter experience (so, most of the time i agree with kak david) make it less interesting for me, im so sorry kak david.
15. there's a webinar which i find the most interesting of. it's beacuse the topic is sometimes new for me, and each of the speaker are really good at it. i think it's a good thing to have more webinar like this.
16. lastly, i want to talk about english class. i think this is by far the best english class that i personally take. it's laoded with 24 sessions, where each sessions we (a group of 4-5) will discuss something about the materials. i favorte part of this class is, ofc that i have a chance to speak english and get an immediate corrections. Bangkit team plase take note how to set up an english class, not just a 3 sessions of english class :D.
17. i think my personal breakthrough is, im definitely has a more self-directed learning vibes than before. im still exploring things that i want to learn, even tho it's outside the program. i think it's a good thing to have.
18. personal growth. i think i grow a lot during this program. i can see my progress on webdev, and also i can see my progress on english. i think i can speak english more fluently than before. i also can see my progress on softskills, even though i still sucks at it.
19. i still on a last step to be graduating from this program, which is a final project. it's a challenge for me and team to make a good final project. i hope we can make it.
20. i hope after finishing this program, the bridge skills between a academia and industry will be more closer. i hope i can utilize this skills to make a better impact for myself, my family, and also my country.
