Reflecting on My Generasi Gigih 3.0 Journey

Generasi Gigih 3.0, a program I came across on Twitter thanks to kak Mikael Dewabrata, marked a significant chapter in my academic journey. As a math major with a passion for computer science, I saw this program as a golden opportunity to dive into the world of web development. In this reflective essay, I will explore my experience during the program.

When I decided to join Generasi Gigih 3.0, I was in my final year of university, and it was during the summer break that I embarked on this educational adventure. The program required me to go through a rigorous admission process, including a programming test. I anticipated that learning web development wouldn't be a walk in the park, especially since it was my first time delving into this field.

As the program began, I was met with a warm welcome from all the stakeholders, mentors, and fellow participants. My initial thoughts were that this journey wouldn't be as easy as my previous experience with Bangkit Academy, as web development was uncharted territory for me. However, I was eager to learn, and I appreciated the support I received from my mentors and peers.


Throughout the program, I found myself relating my experiences to past knowledge and skills. I had previously attempted self-studying web development through resources like Fullstackopen and Project Odin but couldn't focus due to other commitments. Generasi Gigih 3.0 provided me with the structure and guidance I needed to finally delve into web development seriously.

As the weeks passed, I began to understand the intricacies of web development. The synchronous classes led by kak Krisna Firdaus, Zahrah Ayu Afifah Febriani, Ananda Affan Fattahila, Varianto Angga Prawira, and Jessica Cecilia Budianto were instrumental in my learning journey.

With each passing week, I grew more confident in my web development skills. Unlike Bangkit, I noticed that Generasi Gigih 3.0 had a stronger emphasis on hard skill classes, which I found particularly valuable. The program also offered soft skills classes by kak David Paulus, and while I appreciated his expertise, I sometimes found it challenging to engage fully due to my lack of interest in the topic, I'm sorry kak David :D.

One highlight of the program was the webinars, where I was exposed to new topics and insights from experienced speakers. These sessions were intellectually stimulating and added depth to my learning experience.

The English classes were another standout feature. With 24 sessions, I had the opportunity to discuss materials in small groups, allowing me to improve my English speaking and receive immediate corrections. I believe this approach should be adopted by more programs.

Generasi Gigih 3.0 has contributed significantly to my personal growth. I have become more self-directed in my learning, exploring topics beyond the program's scope. My web development and English skills have improved, and I've gained valuable insights into soft skills.

As I near the end of the program, my focus shifts to the final project, which presents a significant challenge. However, I am optimistic that my team and I can rise to the occasion and deliver a compelling project.

Generasi Gigih 3.0 has been an incredible journey of personal and professional growth. It has equipped me with web development skills, improved my English proficiency, and enhanced my self-directed learning abilities. My progress is evident, yet I acknowledge that I have more to learn, particularly in the realm of soft skills.

As I approach the final project, I embrace the challenge with enthusiasm, knowing that it represents the culmination of my efforts. I am confident that the skills and knowledge I've acquired will serve me well in this endeavor and in my future career.

In retrospect, this program has not only broadened my horizons but also instilled in me a sense of determination and self-directed learning. I am excited about the future and how I can utilize these newfound skills to create a better tomorrow, not only for myself but for my family, my country, and beyond. Generasi Gigih 3.0 has been a stepping stone towards a brighter and more impactful future, and I look forward to the journey ahead.
